## Introduction
  
In this project I have developed a program that can inspect and query close approaches of Near-Earth-Objects moments in the past (or future) at which an asteroid (or comet-like object in space) passes quite close to Earth. There is over 200 years of data from CSV and JSON files into Python models. This project also involves a database capable of answering questions such as “when does Halley’s comet pass by Earth?” and “what are the next ten close approaches of big, hazardous asteroids whose orbit takes them exceptionally close to Earth.” Finally, this project allows the user to save the results back to CSV or JSON files. This project  demonstrates an ability to represent data in Python, transform that data using principles of function and object-based design, and connect to external data sources.

## Understanding the Near-Earth Object Close Approach Datasets

This project contains two important data sets, and the first step will be to explore and understand the data containing within these structured files.

One dataset (`neos.csv`) contains information about semantic, physical, orbital, and model parameters for certain small bodies (asteroids and comets, mostly) in our solar system. The other dataset (`cad.json`) contains information about NEO close approaches - moments in time when the orbit of an astronomical body brings it close to Earth. NASA helpfully provides a [glossary](https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/glossary/) to define any unfamiliar terms you might encounter.

## Running the Project 

clone the repo:
```
https://github.com/SreeramVipparla/nd303-c1-advanced-python-techniques-project-starter.git
``` 


This project is driven by the `main.py` script. That means that you'll run `python3 main.py ... ... ...` at the command line to invoke the program that will call your code.

At a command line, you can run `python3 main.py --help` for an explanation of how to invoke the script.

```python
usage: main.py [-h] [--neofile NEOFILE] [--cadfile CADFILE] {inspect,query,interactive} ...

Explore past and future close approaches of near-Earth objects.

positional arguments:
  {inspect,query,interactive}

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --neofile NEOFILE     Path to CSV file of near-Earth objects.
  --cadfile CADFILE     Path to JSON file of close approach data.
```

There are three subcommands: `inspect`, `query`, and `interactive`. Let's take a look at the interfaces of each of these subcommands.

### `inspect`

The `inspect` subcommand inspects a single NEO, printing its details in a human-readable format. The NEO is specified with exactly one of the `--pdes` option (the primary designation) and the `--name` option (the IAU name). The `--verbose` flag additionally prints out, in a human-readable form, all known close approaches to Earth made by this NEO. Each of these options has an abbreviated version. To remind yourself of the full interface, you can run `python3 main.py inspect --help`:

```
$ python3 main.py inspect --help
usage: main.py inspect [-h] [-v] (-p PDES | -n NAME)

Inspect an NEO by primary designation or by name.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         Additionally, print all known close approaches of this NEO.
  -p PDES, --pdes PDES  The primary designation of the NEO to inspect (e.g. '433').
  -n NAME, --name NAME  The IAU name of the NEO to inspect (e.g. 'Halley').
```

Here are a few examples of the `inspect` subcommand in action:

```
# Inspect the NEO with a primary designation of 433 (that's Eros!)
$ python3 main.py inspect --pdes 433
NEO 433 (Eros) has a diameter of 16.840 km and is not potentially hazardous.

# Inspect the NEO with an IAU name of "Halley" (that's Halley's Comet!)
$ python3 main.py inspect --name Halley
NEO 1P (Halley) has a diameter of 11.000 km and is not potentially hazardous.

# Attempt to inspect an NEO that doesn't exist.
$ python3 main.py inspect --name fake-comet
No matching NEOs exist in the database.

# Verbosely list information about Ganymed and each of its known close approaches.
# For the record, Ganymed is HUGE - it's the largest known NEO.
$ python3 main.py inspect --verbose --name Ganymed
NEO 1036 (Ganymed) has a diameter of 37.675 km and is not potentially hazardous.
- On 1911-10-15 19:16, '1036 (Ganymed)' approaches Earth at a distance of 0.38 au and a velocity of 17.09 km/s.
- On 1924-10-17 00:51, '1036 (Ganymed)' approaches Earth at a distance of 0.50 au and a velocity of 19.36 km/s.
- On 1998-10-14 05:12, '1036 (Ganymed)' approaches Earth at a distance of 0.46 au and a velocity of 13.64 km/s.
- On 2011-10-13 00:04, '1036 (Ganymed)' approaches Earth at a distance of 0.36 au and a velocity of 14.30 km/s.
- On 2024-10-13 01:56, '1036 (Ganymed)' approaches Earth at a distance of 0.37 au and a velocity of 16.33 km/s.
- On 2037-10-15 18:31, '1036 (Ganymed)' approaches Earth at a distance of 0.47 au and a velocity of 18.68 km/s.
```

For an NEO to be found with the `inspect` subcommand, the given primary designation or IAU name must match the data exactly, so if an NEO is mysteriously missing, double-check the spelling and capitalization.

### `query`

The `query` subcommand is more significantly more advanced - a `query` generates a collection of close approaches that match a set of specified filters, and either displays a limited set of those results to standard output or writes the structured results to a file.

```
$ python3 main.py query --help
usage: main.py query [-h] [-d DATE] [-s START_DATE] [-e END_DATE] [--min-distance DISTANCE_MIN] [--max-distance DISTANCE_MAX]
                     [--min-velocity VELOCITY_MIN] [--max-velocity VELOCITY_MAX] [--min-diameter DIAMETER_MIN]
                     [--max-diameter DIAMETER_MAX] [--hazardous] [--not-hazardous] [-l LIMIT] [-o OUTFILE]

Query for close approaches that match a collection of filters.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LIMIT, --limit LIMIT
                        The maximum number of matches to return. Defaults to 10 if no --outfile is given.
  -o OUTFILE, --outfile OUTFILE
                        File in which to save structured results. If omitted, results are printed to standard output.

Filters:
  Filter close approaches by their attributes or the attributes of their NEOs.

  -d DATE, --date DATE  Only return close approaches on the given date, in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g. 2020-12-31).
  -s START_DATE, --start-date START_DATE
                        Only return close approaches on or after the given date, in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g. 2020-12-31).
  -e END_DATE, --end-date END_DATE
                        Only return close approaches on or before the given date, in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g. 2020-12-31).
  --min-distance DISTANCE_MIN
                        In astronomical units. Only return close approaches that pass as far or farther away from Earth as the given
                        distance.
  --max-distance DISTANCE_MAX
                        In astronomical units. Only return close approaches that pass as near or nearer to Earth as the given
                        distance.
  --min-velocity VELOCITY_MIN
                        In kilometers per second. Only return close approaches whose relative velocity to Earth at approach is as fast
                        or faster than the given velocity.
  --max-velocity VELOCITY_MAX
                        In kilometers per second. Only return close approaches whose relative velocity to Earth at approach is as slow
                        or slower than the given velocity.
  --min-diameter DIAMETER_MIN
                        In kilometers. Only return close approaches of NEOs with diameters as large or larger than the given size.
  --max-diameter DIAMETER_MAX
                        In kilometers. Only return close approaches of NEOs with diameters as small or smaller than the given size.
  --hazardous           If specified, only return close approaches of NEOs that are potentially hazardous.
  --not-hazardous       If specified, only return close approaches of NEOs that are not potentially hazardous.
```

### `interactive`

There's a third useful subcommand named `interactive`. This subcommand first loads the database and then starts a command loop so that you can repeatedly run `inspect` and `query` subcommands on the database without having to wait to reload the data each time you want to run a new command, which saves an extraordinary amount of time. This can be extremely helpful, as it lets you speed up your development cycle and even show off the project more easily to friends.

Here's what an example session might look like:

```
$ python3 main.py interactive
Explore close approaches of near-Earth objects. Type `help` or `?` to list commands and `exit` to exit.

(neo) inspect --pdes 433
NEO 433 (Eros) has a diameter of 16.840 km and is not potentially hazardous.
(neo) help i
Shorthand for `inspect`.
(neo) i --name Halley
NEO 1P (Halley) has a diameter of 11.000 km and is not potentially hazardous.
(neo) query --date 2020-12-31 --limit 2
On 2020-12-31 05:48, '2010 PQ10' approaches Earth at a distance of 0.45 au and a velocity of 21.69 km/s.
On 2020-12-31 16:00, '2015 YA' approaches Earth at a distance of 0.17 au and a velocity of 5.65 km/s.
(neo) q --date 2021-3-14 --min-velocity 10
On 2021-03-14 06:17, '2019 DS1' approaches Earth at a distance of 0.39 au and a velocity of 20.17 km/s.
On 2021-03-14 20:19, '483656' approaches Earth at a distance of 0.06 au and a velocity of 12.09 km/s.
...
```

The prompt is `(neo) `. At the prompt, you can enter either an `inspect` or a `query` subcommand, with the exact same options and behavior as you would on the command line. You can use the special command `quit`, `exit`, or `CTRL+D` to exit this session and return to the command line. The command `help` or `?` shows a help menu, and `help <command>` (e.g. `help query`) shows a help menu specific to that command. In this environment only, you can also use the short forms `i` and `q` for `inspect` and `query` (e.g. `(neo) i --verbose --name Ganymed)`).

Importantly, **the `interactive` session doesn't automatically update when you update your code.** This means that, if you make a meaningful change to your Python files, you should exit and restart the session. If the interactive session detects that any Python files have changed since it began, it will warn you before it runs each new command. The `interactive` subcommand takes an optional argument `--aggressive` - if specified, the interactive session will instead preemptively exit whenever it notices any changes to any Python files.

All in all, the `interactive` subcommand has the following options:

```
$ python3 main.py interactive --help
usage: main.py interactive [-h] [-a]

Start an interactive command session to repeatedly run `interact` and `query` commands.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
  -a, --aggressive  If specified, kill the session whenever a project file is modified.
```
