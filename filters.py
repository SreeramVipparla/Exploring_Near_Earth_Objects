"""Provide filters for querying close approaches and limit the generated
results. The `create_filters` function produces a collection of objects that is
used by the `query` method to generate a stream of `CloseApproach` objects that
match all of the desired criteria. The arguments to `create_filters` are
provided by the main module and originate from the user's command-line options.
This function can be thought to return a collection of instances of subclasses.

of `AttributeFilter` - a 1-argument callable (on a `CloseApproach`)
constructed from a comparator (from the `operator` module), a reference value,
and a class method `get` that subclasses can override to fetch an attribute
of interest from the supplied `CloseApproach`.
The `limit` function simply limits the maximum number of values produced by an
iterator.
