"""Convert datetimes to and from strings.

NASA's dataset provides timestamps as naive datetimes (corresponding to UTC).

The `cd_to_datetime` function converts a string, formatted as the `cd` field of
NASA's close approach data, into a Python `datetime`

The `datetime_to_str` function converts a Python `datetime` into a string.
Although `datetime`s already have human-readable string representations, those
representations display seconds, but NASA's data (and our datetimes!) don't
provide that level of resolution, so the output format also will not.
